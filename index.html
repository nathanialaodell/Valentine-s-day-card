                    <br/>
                    You inspire me and are my rock when I need you the most.
                    I want you to know that your patience and willingness to stick  with me even when I am at my busiest and most stressed 
                    has been a constant reminder of how lucky I am to have you in my life--especially since I know me being in Seattle is so hard for you (did you know that sometimes seeing an old picture of you smiling is enough to make me happy on even my worst days?). 
                    I don't know where I'd be without you, and I hope I never find out.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Thank you for all you do, and for being you. I love you more than words could ever hope to describe.
